ROOTS PURITY Hyaluronic Acid Serum

Capacity: 30 ml

Hyaluronic Acid Serum deeply nourishes and moisturizes the skin, as exposure to pollution and ultraviolet rays causes a decrease in the amount of hyaluronic acid in the skin, thus drying the skin and making it weak and unable to resist signs of fatigue and aging. Here comes the importance of support with this serum, as it will compensate for the deficiency in the amount of hyaluronic acid and lead to improving skin health and removing wrinkles and fine lines

Contains Vitamin B5, which works to nourish the skin and its layers in an excellent way

Contains Vitamin E, an antioxidant that works to restore the luster of the skin

How to use: Apply the serum in the morning and evening, as a sufficient amount of serum is placed on the clean skin of the face and neck, and massage in a regular circular motion for ten minutes to stimulate blood circulation and accelerate the absorption of the effective serum
